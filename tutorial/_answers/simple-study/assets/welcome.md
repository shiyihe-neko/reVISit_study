This study is an example study that a tutorial attendee can use to learn how to use ReVISit. The study is designed to be simple and easy to build, and it is intended to be used as a starting point for building more complex studies. The study consists of a single task that presents a series of images to the participant. The participant is asked to rate each image on a scale from 1 to 5. The study also includes a survey that asks the participant to provide some demographic information.
