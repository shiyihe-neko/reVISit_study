### ⚠️ **Before you begin the study, please read the following carefully**:


## 🚫 **What You SHOULD NOT Do**
### <span style="background:#ffe5e5; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #d40000;">These actions will result in an "Incomplete" submission and **NO Compensation**.</span>

**1. Do NOT skip required parts of the task or submit partial answers.**  
   *For example: If asked for 6 hex values, providing only 4 = imcomplete.*

**2. Do NOT participate without genuine effort or verbal engagement.**  
   *For example:* 
   - *Staying silent during the parts we ask you to Think-Aloud.*
   - *Random / rushed clicking without thinking*

**3. Do NOT close the browser, refresh the page, mute audio, or stop screen recording.**  
   *Any recording interruption = automatically invalid.*

**4. Do NOT use fully automated programs or bots that complete the entire task on your behalf.**  
   *The study is about **human interaction**, not automated completion.*


## ✅ **What You ARE Allowed To Do**
### <span style="background:#e6ffe6; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #008000;">These behaviors are expected and will ensure **SUCCESSFUL Compensation**.</span>

**1. You CAN use outside resources for inspiration or clarification.** 
   *For example, using Google to look up color theory or asking LLMs for suggestions on palettes.* 

**2. Choose a quiet time when you can focus and finish in one sitting.**  
   *We are studying real human decision-making, so your thoughtful engagement is highly valuable.*

**3. Please make sure:** 
- *All required inputs are fully completed.*
- *You only click “Next” when you are truly ready to proceed, as you will not be able to go back once you advance.*
- *Your screen and audio recording are continuously running, especially during the required Think-Aloud portions.*


## ✅ Final Confirmation
> **I have read and understood the rules, and I agree to complete the study without interrupting the recording or using automated tools.**
