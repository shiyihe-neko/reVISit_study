<!-- ### ⚠️ **Before you begin the study, please read the following carefully**:

1.Please read the task instructions carefully. Your attempts will be monitored and recorded. Submissions that do not follow this guideline <b style="color:red;">will be marked as incomplete and will not be compensated</b>(e.g., if you are asked to input six color hex values but only provide four).

---

2.Additionally, <b style="color:red;">any attempt that appears not serious</b> — for example, if there is no verbal engagement or the effort seems insincere — <b style="color:red;">will be considered incomplete and will not be compensated</b>.

---

3.We will ask for your permission to record your screen and audio in the following section. Once you grant permission, please do not close the window or stop the screen recording until the entire study is completed. Otherwise, your submission <b style="color:red;">will be considered incomplete and will not be compensated</b>.

---

4.One of our interests is understanding how long this study takes. We kindly ask that you <b style="color:red;">choose a time when you can focus</b> - your careful input will help us gather meaningful data. 

---

5.Please remember that this study focuses on understanding how real people — not AI tools — interact with color palette tools. You are <b style="color:red;">welcome to seek suggestions or hints from LLMs</b>, but please <b style="color:red;">do not use built-in browser bots, extensions, or other automated tools to complete the ENTIRE study</b>. We will record your screen and review the session carefully. Since this is a **Think-Aloud Study**, researchers will analyze both the audio and screen recordings. If your actions appear unnatural or inconsistent with genuine human behavior, your submission will be considered <b style="color:red;">ineligible for compensation</b>. Your thoughtful responses are what make this meaningful.

## 🚫 **What You SHOULD NOT Do**
### <span style="background:#ffe5e5; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #d40000;">These actions will result in an “Incomplete” submission and **NO compensation**.</span>

1. **Do NOT skip required parts of the task or submit partial answers.**  
   *For example: If asked for 6 hex values, providing only 4 = rejected.*

2. **Do NOT participate without genuine effort or verbal engagement.**  
   - Staying silent during a Think-Aloud study  
   - Random / rushed clicking  
   - Copy-paste answers without thinking  
   → Considered **insincere participation**.

3. **Do NOT close the browser, refresh the page, mute audio, or stop screen recording.**  
   → Any recording interruption = automatically invalid.

4. **Do NOT use browser automation, AI extensions, auto-fill tools, or built-in palette generators.**  
   → The study is about **human interaction**, not automated completion.

5. **Do NOT let an AI complete the entire task for you.**  
   - ✅ Asking LLMs for *advice or inspiration* is allowed  
   - ❌ Copying full AI-generated answers and submitting them as your own is **not allowed**

## ✅ **What You ARE Encouraged To Do**
### <span style="background:#e6ffe6; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #008000;">These behaviors are expected and will ensure successful compensation.</span>

1. **Read the task instructions carefully before starting.**  
   You may scroll back and re-check details anytime.

2. **Think out loud while you work.**  
   This is a Think-Aloud Study — we care about your thoughts, confusion, reasoning, and decisions.

3. **You *may* ask LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) for suggestions or ideas.**  
   - ✅ Allowed: “What is a calming color palette?”  
   - ✅ Allowed: “How do I check contrast ratio?”  
   - ❌ Not allowed: “Generate the final answer for me so I don’t have to think.”

4. **Choose a quiet time when you can focus and finish in one sitting.**  
   Your pace and thought process are part of the data — there is no “fastest” time.

5. **Before submitting, please check:**  
   - All required inputs are completed  
   - You have been speaking during the task  
   - The screen + audio recording is still running until the very end

### ✅ Final Confirmation Button Text
> **I have read and understood the rules, and I agree to complete the study without interrupting the recording or using automated tools.**
