### Accessibility
When designing a color palette, accessibility is essential.

People with color vision deficiencies (CVD) may find certain color combinations difficult to distinguish.
For example, the two figures below show a comparison: the left image represents how people without CVD see the colors, while the right image simulates how they appear to someone with Deuteranopia.
To make your palette accessible, choose colors that differ not only in hue but also in brightness and contrast.

High contrast helps everyone perceive differences more easily, especially when text or small shapes are involved. Contrast also interacts with background modes, a palette that works well in light mode may become unreadable in dark mode. The figures below compare how the same colors appear in dark and light modes. In dark mode (top), the pale colors stand out clearly against the black background. However, in light mode (bottom), the same colors lose contrast and become difficult to distinguish.
