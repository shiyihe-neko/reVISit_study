## Welcome!
In this short tutorial, you'll learn about different types of color palettes, how color relates to accessibility, and how to create your own palette using **Leonardo**.

### Types of Color Palettes
There are three common types of color palettes used in data visualization: categorical, sequential, and diverging.

A *categorical(or qualitative) palette* is used to distinguish between discrete categories, for example, different countries, product types, or user groups. Each color represents a separate category, and the colors should be easily distinguishable from one another. For example, the bar chart below uses a categorical color palettes to represent different groups.

A *sequential palette* is used to represent ordered or numeric data, like temperature, population, or scores. The colors usually go from light to dark to show increasing magnitude. For example, the heatmap below uses a sequential color palette to represent the daily maximum temperature in Seattle, where color lightness indicates temperature intensity.

A diverging palette is used when the data has a meaningful midpoint. For example, changes from positive to negative, or above vs. below average. The colors diverge from a neutral middle color toward two extremes. For example, the bar chart below uses a diverging color palette to represent responses ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". The palette uses contrasting hues to highlight the two opposing opinions, with neutral tones in the middle indicating balanced responses.

### Accessibility
When designing a color palette, accessibility is essential.

People with color vision deficiencies (CVD) may find certain color combinations difficult to distinguish.
For example, the two figures below show a comparison: the left image represents how people without CVD see the colors, while the right image simulates how they appear to someone with Deuteranopia.
To make your palette accessible, choose colors that differ not only in hue but also in brightness and contrast.

High contrast helps everyone perceive differences more easily, especially when text or small shapes are involved. Contrast also interacts with background modes, a palette that works well in light mode may become unreadable in dark mode. The figures below compare how the same colors appear in dark and light modes. In dark mode (top), the pale colors stand out clearly against the black background. However, in light mode (bottom), the same colors lose contrast and become difficult to distinguish.
