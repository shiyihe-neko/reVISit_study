# Task 1: Wrangling Game Rating Dataset

You are a data analyst at a gaming media outlet, and you need to analyze how User Scores have trended by Genre since the year 2000. The raw data is currently too messy for the pipeline. Please clean it using the assigned tool.

In this task, you will clean the provided dataset using the assigned tool - <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>. Your goal is to prepare a dataset in which all fields relevant to the analysis are clean, consistent, and ready for computing annual average scores. Please select appropriate wrangling strategies and correct abnormal values where necessary.

## Your Goal:

**Filter**: You are only interested in the modern era. Please exclude any records released prior to <b>2000</b>.

**Standardize**: Ensure **'User_Score'** is numeric and ready for aggregation.

**Quality Control**: We need a high-quality dataset. Trends will be invisible if the data contains abnormalities such as missing values, type errors, unreasonable outliers, or any other inconsistencies. So please choose <b>REASONABLE</b> strategies to deal with those abnormalities.

**Be Conservative**: Avoid aggressively deleting rows. When data is messy, prioritize preserving records by imputing missing values using reasonable, defensible logic to improve data <b>Completeness</b>. Only remove rows when doing so is clearly necessary.

**Context Matters**: Be careful when flagging outliers. A value that looks strange globally might be normal within its specific subgroup. Think of housing prices as an example: a price that is an outlier for the whole country might be normal for a city like New York. Verifying anomalies within their groups before removing them is valuable.
