# Task 2：Wrangling Used Cars Dataset
You are a data analyst at a used-car trading platform, and your task is to prepare a dataset for training a "Car Price Model" across various manufacturers. The raw data is currently too messy for the modeling pipeline, so you must clean and refine it using the assigned tool.

In this task, you will clean the provided dataset using <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>. Your goal is to produce a dataset in which all fields relevant to the analysis are clean, consistent, and ready for modeling. Apply appropriate data-wrangling strategies, select reasonable features for predicting the target variable <b>price</b>, and correct anomalies, inconsistent values, etc., when necessary to ensure the dataset is suitable for modeling.

## Your Goal:

**Standardize Data Types**: Identify the columns valuable for building the model and ensure they are assigned the correct data types. For instance, ensure numerical values are consistently numeric and descriptive labels are categorical.

**Clean Anomalies**: Identify and resolve data quality issues such as null values, type mismatches, outliers, or any other inconsistencies. Please apply reasonable strategies to correct these abnormalities. 

**Be Conservative**: Avoid aggressively deleting rows. When data is messy, prioritize preserving records by imputing missing values using reasonable, defensible logic to improve data completeness. Only remove rows when doing so is clearly necessary.

**Context Matters**: Be careful when flagging outliers. A value that appears to be a global outlier may be normal within its specific subgroup. For example, a price of $250,000 might be an error for a "Ford," but perfectly valid for a "Ferrari."


## Estimated Time
Approximately 15 – 25 minutes. But there is no strict time limit for this task, work at your own pace and submit your results once you feel the task is complete. Please do your best to wrangle the data and identify any anomalies. Remember that your goal is to produce a clean dataset that is suitable for modeling.

## External Help
You CAN use outside resources for inspiration or clarification. For example, using Google or LLMs for any data wrangling suggestions.
