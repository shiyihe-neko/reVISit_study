# Introduction

Welcome to our study. This is a demo study that uses stimuli built by [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/). reVISit support both Vega and Vega-lite stimuli.
With Vega, reVISit can also track user interactions. To track interactions, define them in in [Signals](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/signals/). 

## Vega Demo 1
The first demo is a basic bar chart with hover interaction to show tooltips. Participants need to click on the chart to answer the question.

## Vega Demo 2
The second demo is a more complex visualization. It uses a movie dataset, participants can select which attributes to use for the scatter plot axis.
