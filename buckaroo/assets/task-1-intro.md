# ☕️ Task 1 — Detect and Fix Abnormal Cupper Points

## 🧭 Background
In this task, you will work with a dataset containing coffee ratings. Each row represents a coffee sample from a specific country and owner, evaluated by professional graders ("cuppers") across various sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and sweetness, etc,. 

The column **'Cupper.Points'** records the grade's **overall score** for each coffee sample — a key indicator of coffee quality.  
However, this column contains several issues introduced during data entry or aggregation:
- **Type mismatches**
- **Outliers**
- **Missing values** 

Your task is to **detect and repair these anomalies**.

---

## 🧩 Task Instructions
Please focus on the column **'Cupper.Points'** and complete the following steps:

**1. Detect Type Mismatches**  
   - Identify values that are not numeric.  
   - Convert them into numeric values consistent with other entries (e.g., `"12k"` → `12.0`).  

**2. Detect Outliers**  
   - Define outliers as values outside the range of **mean ± 2 × standard deviation**.  
   - Replace these outlier values with the **mean of all valid (non-outlier) values**.

**3. Detect Missing Values**  
   - If there are missing values (`NaN`), fill them using the **mean of all valid (non-missing) values** in the same column.

## ✅ Success Criteria
| Criterion | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Type Consistency** | All entries in **'Cupper.Points'** should be numeric. |
| **Outlier Repair** | Values beyond mean ± 2σ replaced correctly |
| **Missing Value Repair** | No `NaN` or extreme values should remain. All `NaN`s filled with the mean |
