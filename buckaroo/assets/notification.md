### ⚠️ **Before you begin the study, please read the following carefully**:


## 🚫 **What You SHOULD NOT Do**
### <span style="background:#ffe5e5; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #d40000;">These actions will result in an "Incomplete" submission and **NO Compensation**.</span>

**1. Do NOT participate without genuine effort or verbal engagement.**  

   For example:  
   - Random or careless editing without trying to detect or fix data issues.  
   - Staying silent during the parts we ask you to Think-Aloud.
   - Stopping midway without saving or submitting results.  
   Please follow the full task workflow demonstrated in the tutorial, including data cleaning steps and result submission.  
   ***<b style="color:Orange;">We understand you might not fully complete every task, that’s fine, but we need to see genuine effort and a full attempt following the required process.</b> All submissions will be reviewed via recorded playback to ensure completeness.***

**2. Respect task-specific time instructions.**  

   - **Task 1** has a time limit — please try your best within the allotted time.  
     You may proceed to Task 2 even if you are not fully finished.  
   - **Task 2** has no time limit — you may continue until you feel satisfied with your cleaned results.  

**3. Do NOT close the browser, refresh the page, mute audio, or stop screen recording.**  

   *Any recording interruption = **automatically invalid**.*

**3. Do NOT use fully automated programs or bots that complete the entire task on your behalf.**  

   *The study is about **human interaction**, not automated completion.*


## ✅ **What You ARE Allowed To Do**
### <span style="background:#e6ffe6; padding:6px 10px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #008000;">These behaviors are expected and will ensure **SUCCESSFUL Compensation**.</span>

**1. You CAN use outside resources for inspiration or clarification.**

   *For example, using Google or LLMs for data cleaning suggestions.* 

**2. Choose a quiet time when you can focus and finish in one sitting.**  

   *We are studying real human decision-making, so your thoughtful engagement is highly valuable.*

**3. Please make sure:** 
- *You only click “Next” when you are truly ready to proceed, as you will not be able to go back once you advance.*
- *Your screen and audio recording are continuously running, especially during the required Think-Aloud portions.*


## ✅ Final Confirmation
> **I have read and understood the rules, and I agree to complete the study without interrupting the recording or using automated tools.**
